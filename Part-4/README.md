# Part 4 - Analogue to Digital/Digital to Analogue Converters & Echo Synthesise

In the final lab we pieced all of the different labs together to look at how we can do real time digital audio processing. The experiments we did were:

* Experiment 16: An	Audio	In-and-Out	(All	Pass)	Loop
* Experiment 17: Echo	Synthesizer	with Fixed Delay
* Experiment 18: Multiple	Echoes
