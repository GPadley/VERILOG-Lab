# Part 2 - Counters and Finite State Machines

This part of the lab aims to teach us how to learn how to design and implement counters and timers and implement them into designs and also how to use ModelSim to simulate timing diagrams.

The Experiments we have done are:

* Experiment 5: Designing	a	Counter
* Experiment 6: Implementing a 16-bit counter on DE1
* Experiment 7:	Linear Feedback	Shift	Register (LFSR)	and	PRBS
* Experiment 8: Starting Line	Delay	Circuit
