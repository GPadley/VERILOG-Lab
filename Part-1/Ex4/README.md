# Experiment 4 - Displaying 10-Bit Binary as BCD Digits on the 7 Segment Displays

In this exercise, we had to look at how we can convert binary to binary coded decimal so that when we display it on the 7 segment displays, we are shown the binary value opposed to the hexadecimal value. With 10 bits, the maximum decimal value you can have is 1023, so for the display we need to have 4 7 segment displays.

The way that the conversion of the binary is done is through shifting the bits in from the bottom of
