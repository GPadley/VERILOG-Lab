# Experiment 3 - 10-Bit Binary Switch on 3 7 Segment Displays

The aim of this experiment is to see if we are able to take initiative and take the 10 bit switch value and put it onto the first 3 7 segment displays. The way to do this was to:

1. Alter the size of the switch input
2. Add on extra 7 segment display outputs
3. Create a top file in which implements this

To start off we looked at the "**pin_assignment.txt**" file to see what the next 7 segment displays were defined as and luckily they are called HEX1 and HEX2, so adding these in to the new project we wrote the top file:
