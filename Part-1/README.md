# Part 1 - Schematics Vs. Verilog

In this part of the Lab, we will be looking at how Verilog is more efficient in digital programming rather than using schematic diagrams, we have 4 experiments to do:

* Experiment 1 - Schematic Capture using Quartus II - 7 Segment Display
* Experiment 2 - 7 Segment decoder in Verilog HDL
* Experiment 3 - 10-Bit Binary Switch Values on Three 7 Segment Displays
* Experiment 4 - Displaying 10-Bit binary as BCD Digits on 7 Segment Displays

To set up the board before begining when starting up Quartus II you go to:

**File -> New Project Wizard -> Choose the folder to host the project -> Name the project Ex"n" and the top file Ex"n"_top -> Empty Project -> Family, Device & Board Settings choose 5CSEMA5F31C6 -> Finish**

(n defines the number of experiment we will be starting)
