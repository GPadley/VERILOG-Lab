# Part 1 - Schematics Vs. Verilog

In this part of the Lab, we will be looking at how Verilog is more efficient in digital programming rather than using schematic diagrams, we have 4 experiments to do:

* Experiment 1 - Schematic Capture using Quartus II - 7 Segment Display
* Experiment 2 - 7 Segment decoder in Verilog HDL
* Experiment 3 - 10-Bit Binary Switch Values on Three 7 Segment Displays
* Experiment 4 - Displaying 10-Bit binary as BCD Digits on 7 Segment Displays
