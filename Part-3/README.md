# Part 3 - Digital to Analogue Conversion and Tone Generators

This lab introduced the analogue add on card and how we can do digital to analogue conversion output signals from the DE1 board, the experiments were:

* Experiment 10: Interface with the MCP4911 Digital-to-Analogue Converter
* Experiment 11: D-to-A	conversion Using Pulse-Width	Modulation
* Experiment 12: Designing and Testing	a	Sinewave Table in ROM
* Experiment 13: A Fixed Frequency Sinewave	Generator
* Experiment 14: A Variable Sinewave Generator
