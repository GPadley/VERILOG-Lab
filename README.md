# VERILOG-Lab
EEE Year 2 Lab Book

This lab is all about learning how hardware can be interfaced through software. Verilog is a hardware description language used to model electronic systems, through using this we were able to take the concepts which we have been taught in Digital Electronics lectures and view how they are implemented.
