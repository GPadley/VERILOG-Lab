# VERILOG-Lab
EEE Year 2 Lab Book

This lab is all about learning how hardware can be interfaced through software. Verilog is a hardware description language used to model electronic systems, through using this we were able to take the concepts which we have been taught in Digital Electronics lectures and view how they are implemented.
There are 4 parts of the lab, each taking one lab session, to teach us how to use Verilog.
They are:

* Part 1 - Schematics Vs. Verilog
* Part 2 - Counters and Finite State Machines
* Part 3 - Digital to Analogue Conversion and Tone Generators
* Part 4 - Analogue to Digital/Digital to Analogue Converters & Echo Synthesiser

The board used for the Lab was the Altera Cyclone V board in which we also had an external Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) in which was developed for the lab, to enable us to see how real time digital to analogue and analogue to digital conversion works.

The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in which we used to write, compile and program the Cyclone V board with was Quartus Prime 16.1.
